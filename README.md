# My-Fedora-Sway-Configuration

This is a configuration for sway window manager fanboys. Since window manager doesn't ship with everything under the hood, It requires her
users to set up alot of staff manually. I have enabled the following functionalities on my window manager
1. Increase and Decrease screen brightness.

# How to use My sway config file
Navigate to `~/.config/sway/config` and copy paste my file content to your config file. No need to worry, the defualt sway config are still availabe at /etc/sway/config

# Reasons to use window manager
1. It helps one adopt the habbit of using keyboard and not relying on mouse.
2. It's fast and saves time.
